Hello, this is the read-me file about my Mobile App Design and Development. 
My app is called HikeHub Aberdeen and allows users to find walks and trails and parks around Aberdeen. Here is all the functionality:
- Home Page which allows user to pick Parks, Hikes or Coatal walks
- Page displaying parks, multiple different parks to choose from which will display the details about that specific park
- Hike page allows users to pick the difficulty of hike between easy, medium and hard
- Selecting any of these options will take users to a page with hikes based on their level
- Selcting a hike will show a description and image and route, based on the hike selected
- There's also the option for coastal walks, which displays details about a coastal walk around Aberdeen based on the coastal walk the user selects
- There's a weather page which pulls in data from a weather API and displays details about the current weather in Abereden, with data such as current temperature, wind speed, sunset time, etc.
- A profile page which allows users to add a selected route to a to-do-list which is stored in local storage and displayed.
